# Java Hybrid Stream Example

This is an example of writing and reading hybrid streams in java. A hybrid stream is just a regular character stream, and a binary stream that are open together, on the same binary stream.

The code is taken from the last module [Dealing with Hybrid Streams of Text and Bytes](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=java-fundamentals-input-output&author=jose-paumard&name=dfbf5974-c66a-479b-89ed-87d01d4010d7&clip=0&mode=live) of [Jose Paumard](@JosePaumard) 's [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [Java Fundamentals: Input/Output](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-fundamentals-input-output).
